The project has a typical structure for a FastAPI-based application with various components like:

- **app/**: Likely the main application directory.
- **alembic/**: Database migrations folder (Alembic).
- **models/**: Database models.
- **telegram_bot/**: Possibly a module for handling the Telegram bot functionality.
- **migrations/**: Additional migration-related files.
- **templates/**: HTML templates (likely for rendering).
- **static/**: Static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.).
- **run_bot.py**: Script to run the Telegram bot.
- **Dockerfile**: Docker setup for the project.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Configuration for Docker Compose to manage multi-container Docker applications.
- **alembic.ini**: Alembic configuration.
- **setup.py**: Script for packaging the project.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies.
- **celery_worker.py**: Celery worker for asynchronous task handling.

# Project Name

## Description

This project is a FastAPI-based application designed to handle various functionalities, including real-time messaging, Telegram bot integration, and database management. The application leverages several technologies like Docker, Celery, Alembic for migrations, and PostgreSQL.

## Features

- **FastAPI** for building the web API.
- **WebSocket** support for real-time messaging.
- **PostgreSQL** as the main database.
- **Alembic** for database migrations.
- **Redis** for asynchronous task handling.
- **Celery** for background job processing.
- **Telegram Bot Integration** for notifications or interaction.
- **Docker** and **docker-compose** for containerization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
